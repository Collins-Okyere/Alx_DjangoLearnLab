class AuthorSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """
    Serializer for the Author model.

    This serializer handles serialization and deserialization of Author instances.
    It includes a nested BookSerializer to display books authored by each author.

    Fields:
        - name: The author's name.
        - books: A nested list of books written by the author, using BookSerializer.

    Relationship Handling:
        - The `books` field uses `BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)`, which
          allows nested representation of books associated with an author.
        - `read_only=True` ensures that books are only included in the response
          and are not directly created through this serializer.

    Example Output:
    ```json
    {
        "name": "J.K. Rowling",
        "books": [
            {
                "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
                "publication_year": 1997,
                "author": 1
